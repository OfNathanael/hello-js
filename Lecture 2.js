//NPM is a bult-in tool for installing, managing, and sharing packages of code. It is the default package manager for Node.js and is used to install and manage dependencies for JavaScript projects. With NPM, you can easily install packages from the NPM registry, which contains thousands of open-source packages that can be used in your projects. You can also use NPM to manage your project's dependencies, update packages, and publish your own packages to the registry.
//Core commands are:
//npm init - Initializes a new Node.js project and creates a package.json file.
//npm install <package-name> - Installs a package and its dependencies.
//npm update <package-name> - Updates a package to the latest version.
//npm uninstall <package-name> - Uninstalls a package and removes it from the dependencies.
//npm list - Lists all installed packages and their dependencies.
//npm publish - Publishes a package to the NPM registry.
//npm run <script-name> - Runs a script defined in the package.json file.
//Modules break code into reusable chunks. They allow you to organize your code and share it across different parts of your application or even with other developers. In Node.js, you can create modules by exporting functions, objects, or values from a file and then importing them in another file using the require() function. This helps to keep your code clean and maintainable, as well as promotes code reusability.
//Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs. It simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests and responses, routing, middleware, and more. With Express.js, you can easily create server-side applications, handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.), and manage routes to serve different content based on the URL. It is widely used for building web applications and APIs due to its simplicity and flexibility.
//The package.json file is a crucial component of a Node.js project that contains metadata about the project, such as its name, version, dependencies, scripts, and more. It serves as a manifest for the project and allows developers to manage and share their code effectively. The package.json file is created using the npm init command and can be edited manually to add or update information about the project. It is essential for managing dependencies and ensuring that the project can be easily installed and run by other developers.
//Express middleware is a function that has access to the request and response objects in an Express.js application. It can perform various tasks such as modifying the request or response, executing code, or ending the request-response cycle. Middleware functions are executed in the order they are defined and can be used for tasks like logging, authentication, error handling, and more. They help to keep the code organized and modular by allowing you to separate different concerns into different middleware functions.
//The JSON parsing middleware parses incoming JSON payloads and makes the data available in req.body. It is essential for handling JSON data sent in HTTP requests, such as when a client sends a POST request with a JSON body. By using this middleware, you can easily access and manipulate the data sent by the client in your route handlers.
//Route parameters are dynamic segments in a URL that can be used to capture values from the URL and make them available in the request object. They are defined using a colon (:) followed by the parameter name in the route path. For example, in the route /users/:id, :id is a route parameter that can capture the value of the id from the URL. This allows you to create dynamic routes that can handle different values and perform actions based on those values, such as retrieving user information based on their ID.
